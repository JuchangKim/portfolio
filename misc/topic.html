<h5>Defining the topic(Government Facilities Data Collection)</h5><br>
Most of data created during this period will be generated by machines
 communicating with one another through data networks (Stair, Raiph M, and George Reynolds, 2017).<br>
<br>
Government faces new and intense pressure to collect and use personal data. (Cate, Fred H, 2008)<br>
Numerous government agencies are advocating for the automation and computerization of their operations, leading to a significant increases in data usage and collection from citizens.<br>
<br>
Governments are getting more automating and increase enormous amount of data which is include personal information. We believe it is connected to people and would be important our lives.<br>
So we should aware of the risk of our privacy from government data collection.
