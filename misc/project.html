<h4>Using Knowledge</h4>
<p>Thread, Synchronisation, Generic Type, Graphic User Interface, Key input, List etc.</p>

<h4>Explanation of the Program</h4>
<p>There is a situation of the virus phones. The blue dot is a healthy phone, the red one is an infected phone. <br>
  A bit later, the infected phone needs to go to the repair shop which is in the middle top of the panel. <br>
  The repair shop can fix only one phone at a time, so the other infected phones must wait outside the repair shop. <br>
  After a certain time, the infected phone in the repair shop is fixed and released as a healthy phone,<br>
  then the repair shop gets another infected phone if one is waiting.</p>
<p>When you press the up arrow key on the keyboard, a new healthy phone is created. When you press the 'v' key on the keyboard,<br>
  a healthy phone gets infected randomly. When the healthy phone is close to an infected phone, the healthy phone also gets infected.</p>

<h4>Using Knowledge</h4>
<p>Binary Tree, Graphic User Interface, Text File Input, List, Traversal with Stack Stucture, Recursion etc.</p>
<br>
  <h4>Explanation of the Program</h4>
  <p>When click the program, it request text file input. When the text file which name is maze, the programm get the information from the text file. <br>
  Then the program make segement of the text and input the value to the program from text. Then the program build up a maze which is based on binary tree structure. <br>
  After the building up the maze, the program start to travel to find the exit which shows on the panel of the program. <br>
  The nodes in the panel are linked to next or no node. So the traversal is running by recursion and stack structure. <br>
  when it finds the exit, the traversal is stopped and show the pathway from start to the end on the botton right side.</p>
