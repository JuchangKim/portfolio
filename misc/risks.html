<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>
<p>
	While the government's collection of personal information can be convenient, it can also lead to anxiety since individuals lose control of their data.<br>
	A case in point is the data breach of the US Office of Personnel Management in 2015, where over 21 million records of current and past federal employees were stolen,<br>
	including personal information such as names, addresses, places of birth, and Social Security numbers (Baecker,2019).<br>
	<h5>Challenge</h5>
	A related challenge is to secure institutional support in the form of leadership commitment. Technical challenges are a shortage of relevant talent,<br>
	underdevelopment of relevant software tools, integration of multiple data sources and formats, and data storage and access. (Yu-Che Chen, Tsui-Chuan Hsieh, 2014)<br>
