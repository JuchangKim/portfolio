<h4>Explanation of the Program</h4>
<p>There is a situation of the virus phones. The blue dot is a healthy phone, the red one is an infected phone. A bit later, the infected phone needs to go to the repair shop which is in the middle top of the panel. The repair shop can fix only one phone at a time, so the other infected phones must wait outside the repair shop. After a certain time, the infected phone in the repair shop is fixed and released as a healthy phone, then the repair shop gets another infected phone if one is waiting.</p>
<p>When you press the up arrow key on the keyboard, a new healthy phone is created. When you press the 'v' key on the keyboard, a healthy phone gets infected randomly. When the healthy phone is close to an infected phone, the healthy phone also gets infected.</p>
